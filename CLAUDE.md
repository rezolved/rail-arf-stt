# rail-arf — Rezolve's Canonical ARF Fork

Template repository for starting a Rezolve research project (latency, fine-tuning, RAG,
guardrails, etc.) using the Glite Autonomous Research Framework. Fork this repo and replace this
section with your project-specific description.

This is **not** the upstream Glite ARF template. It is a Rezolve fork-of-fork that adds:

* An Azure ML SSH-VM provisioner (`arf/scripts/utils/azure_ml_vm.py`) wired into the
  `setup-remote-machine` skill — Azure ML is the default GPU provider for Rezolve projects.
* A statistically-significant paired-bootstrap library (`arf/scripts/stats/bootstrap_compare/`)
  with locked seeds, used for any cross-condition comparison.
* A warmup-protocol shape (`arf/scripts/protocols/warmup_runner/`) — engine-agnostic constants and
  spec for the warmup-N + measured-M latency-benchmark pattern.
* A `LESSONS.md` at the repo root capturing hard-won lessons from prior Rezolve research projects,
  encoded as defaults in skills and verificators.

## Commands

```bash
# Setup
# New fork onboarding: run /setup-project in Claude Code or $setup-project in Codex
uv sync                                            # Install deps
uv run pre-commit install                          # Activate git hooks
python3 doctor.py                                  # Validate environment

# Development
uv run python -u <script.py>                                       # Run a script
uv run python -m arf.scripts.utils.run_with_logs --task-id <id> -- <cmd>   # ARF logging

# Quality
uv run flowmark --inplace --nobackup <path.md>      # Format markdown
uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format .   # Lint and format Python
uv run mypy .                                        # Type check
uv run pytest                                        # Run framework tests in arf/tests
```

## Rezolve conventions

* Always write **brainpowa** in lowercase — never "Brainpowa" or "BrainPowa".
* Use the `gh` CLI for GitHub operations (PR reads, diffs, status checks). Never paste credentials
  into the repo.
* Never add a "Generated with Claude Code" promo line to commit messages or PR descriptions.
* The default GPU provider is **Azure ML** (configured via `project/azure_vm.json`). vast.ai is
  supported as a fallback if a project declares it in `available_services`.

## Key Rules

0. Framework / infrastructure / specification / skill / verificator / aggregator / materializer
   changes in `arf/`, generic `meta/`, and generic boilerplate are not task work. Do not create a
   `tasks/tXXXX_*` folder for such changes.
1. All CLI tool calls MUST be wrapped in `arf/scripts/utils/run_with_logs.py`.
2. One task = one folder = one branch = one PR.
3. **NEVER** modify files outside the task folder. Only top-level tooling files may change:
   `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `ruff.toml`, `.gitignore`.
4. Each task stage and each action is a separate well-described commit.
5. Nothing in a completed task folder may be changed; use the corrections mechanism in later tasks.
6. Run `uv run flowmark --inplace --nobackup <changed.md>` on edited markdown files, then run
   `uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format . && uv run mypy .` before commit.
7. Framework tests live in `arf/tests/`. Task-specific tests live in
   `tasks/$TASK_ID/code/test_*.py`. Do not create or use a top-level `tests/` directory.
8. Full data normalization; no duplication across task folders.
9. **Always use aggregators to enumerate cross-task data.** Never walk `tasks/` with
   Glob/Grep/find/Explore to list tasks, papers, suggestions, answers, datasets, libraries, models,
   predictions, costs, metrics, or metric results. Aggregators in `arf/scripts/aggregators/` apply
   the corrections overlay; raw filesystem walks silently miss corrections and produce stale
   answers. See `arf/docs/reference/aggregators.md` for the full list and flags.
10. Read `LESSONS.md` before planning a task that involves latency benchmarks, GPU provisioning,
    quantization, or paired-bootstrap analysis. Each lesson lists the mitigation already wired into
    the framework and the verificator that enforces it.

## Task Workflow

* Tasks live in `tasks/tXXXX_slug/` (t prefix + 4-digit ID + underscore slug).
* Each task runs in its own git worktree on branch `task/<task_id>`.
* Multiple tasks can execute in parallel (each in a separate worktree).
* New tasks branch: `new_tasks/<first_index>-<last_index>`.
* Mandatory stages: research -> planning -> implementation -> analysis -> reporting.
* Every step must be logged in `logs/`; verificators enforce this.
* Aggregators collect data across tasks AND apply corrections overlays — use them instead of walking
  `tasks/` directly (see rule 9).
* Format specs for task documents: `arf/specifications/`.

## Upstream sync

This repo tracks `GliteTech/glite-arf` as the `upstream` remote. To pull upstream framework
improvements:

```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Resolve any conflicts in `arf/` (the framework code), then push. Project-specific files under
`project/`, `meta/`, and `tasks/` are unaffected by upstream rebases.
