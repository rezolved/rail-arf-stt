# Task Objective

Re-analyze existing t0022/t0023 biasing sweeps for the brand-accuracy/WER tradeoff, then test
biasing on top of the existing t0021 fine-tuned checkpoint.

* * *

## Step History

### Step 1 — create-branch

Branch `task/t0024_biasing_pareto_and_ft_biasing_ablation` created. Initial folder structure
initialized in `tasks/t0024_biasing_pareto_and_ft_biasing_ablation/`. Step 1 is a mechanical setup
step with no research output.

### Step 2 — check-deps

`verify_task_dependencies.py` fails on all three deps (TD-E003) due to stale/legacy `task.json`
metadata in t0021/t0022/t0023, not missing data. Direct inspection confirmed the required files
(t0022 `param_sweep.jsonl`, t0023 `tdt_sweep.jsonl`, t0021 clean_eval manifest + DVC audio) are
present and readable. See `logs/steps/002_check-deps/deps_report.json` for the full record.

### Step 4 — research-papers

Skipped (planned at step 1). Pure re-analysis of already-collected internal sweep data (Part A) plus
a confirmatory inference run reusing an established boosting config (Part B); no new methodology to
validate against the paper corpus.

### Step 5 — research-internet

Skipped (planned at step 1). Operates entirely on local data (t0022/t0023 sweep JSONLs, t0021
checkpoint and eval set); no new external tools, APIs, or facts are needed.

### Step 11 — creative-thinking

Skipped (planned at step 1). Both sub-tasks are deliberately narrow and prescriptive (explicit
frontier stance for Part A, single reuse-checkpoint run for Part B) with alternative-approach
exploration explicitly out of scope per the task's stated constraints.

### Step 13 — compare-literature

Skipped (planned at step 1). This task compares internal decoding configs and internal
fine-tune/biasing conditions against each other, not against published external baselines.

## Cross-Step Decisions

* **Dependency metadata caveat (step 2)**: `t0021_parakeet_finetune_vs_biasing` and
  `t0022_gpu_pb_diagnostic` have stale `task.json` `status: "not_started"` fields despite having
  complete, committed `results/`/`data/` output; `t0023_tdt_vs_unified_biasing` uses a legacy
  pre-spec `task.json` schema (no `spec_version`/`task_index`/`expected_assets`,
  `status: "complete"` not `"completed"`) that `verify_task_dependencies.py` /
  `aggregate_tasks.py --ids` cannot resolve. Do NOT modify t0021/t0022/t0023's `task.json` files
  (never edit other tasks' folders) — this is a pre-existing repo data-quality issue, not something
  this task fixes. Any later step that runs `verify_task_dependencies.py`, `aggregate_tasks.py`, or
  similar metadata-based tooling against these three task IDs should expect it to report them as
  incomplete/unresolvable and should treat that as a known false negative — verify the actual needed
  files directly on disk instead (paths listed in the Step 2 history entry above and in
  `logs/steps/002_check-deps/deps_report.json`).

* * *

## Next Step Notes

Step 2 (`check-deps`) is complete. Dependencies are functionally satisfied — the sweep JSONLs and
t0021 clean-eval manifest/audio are present and readable, verified by direct file inspection since
the metadata-based verificator false-negatives on all three deps (see Cross-Step Decisions). The
next step-executor (`init-folders`, step 3) should proceed normally: run `init_task_folders`, which
reads `expected_assets` from this task's own `task.json` (unaffected by the dependency metadata
issue) to scaffold the folder structure.
