# Skills Reference

Skills are reusable agent workflows. Each one lives at `arf/skills/<slug>/SKILL.md`. Claude Code
discovers them via `.claude/skills/<slug>` symlinks; Codex via `.codex/skills/<slug>`.

Format: `arf/specifications/agent_skills_specification.md`.

## Skill File Layout

A skill directory contains:

* `SKILL.md` — required. YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`) plus body sections (Goal, Inputs,
  Context, Steps, Done When, Forbidden)
* Supporting files as needed

Expose the skill via symlinks:

* `.claude/skills/<slug>` → `arf/skills/<slug>`
* `.codex/skills/<slug>` → `arf/skills/<slug>`
